My passion for teaching myself new things drives me through life.

My recent transition of focus to developing my expertise in bioinformatics allows me to leverage my attention to detail while handling large data sets to address pressing questions in transnational biologic research. I thrive on employing my extensive abilities to wrangle big data (including single cell technologies) and include salient statistics to draw meaningful conclusions in a biomedical context. 

I started college as an English major with a passion for creative writing and poetry, but quickly realized my aptitude for biology. My earliest infatuation with big data came from analyzing a microarray data set during my undergraduate work. I set my sights on graduate school, and spent a few years gaining research experience before earning admission to the University of California, San Francisco for graduate school.

In the lab of <a href="https://lairdlab.ucsf.edu/">Diana Laird</a>, I invested in the future by better characterizing early germ-line development. I taught myself `R` and `bash` to tackle complex bioinformatic data sets, including single cell RNA sequencing libraries.
I also ran our lab's Ubuntu computational server. My current work in <a href="https://dscolab.ucsf.edu/">the Data Science CoLab</a> involves contextualizing the most commonly used mouse tumor immunology models against human cancer patient data. As the lead bioinformatician on my project, I closely collaborate with a team of scientists to address these questions.
I am teaching myself python and SQL, as well as expanding my repertoire of data types to include bulk RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and CyTOF.

I crave challenge and enjoy embarking on new adventures, professionally and personally. Empowering the next generation of scientists to understand programming is a dedication of mine. I regularly teach graduate workshops and courses to onboard novice programmers into the world of bioinformatics. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, and play lots of TTRPGs, and flex my artistic muscles while learning 3D CAD modeling and making handmade artisan dice.
