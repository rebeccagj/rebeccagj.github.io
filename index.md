My passion for teaching myself new things drives me through life. I thrive on leveraging my bioinformatics expertise and attention to detail to wrangle big data (including single cell technologies). By utilizing salient statistics, I seek to address pressing questions in translational research and draw meaningful conclusions in a biomedical context. 

I started college as an English major with a passion for creative writing and poetry, but quickly realized my aptitude for biology. My earliest infatuation with big data came from analyzing a microarray data set during my undergraduate work. I set my sights on graduate school, and spent a few years gaining research experience before earning admission to the University of California, San Francisco.

In the lab of <a href="https://lairdlab.ucsf.edu/">Diana Laird</a>, I characterized mammalian early germ-line development. I taught myself `R` and `bash` to tackle complex bioinformatic data sets, including single cell RNA sequencing libraries. I also ran our lab's Ubuntu computational server. My current work in <a href="https://dscolab.ucsf.edu/">the Data Science CoLab</a> involves contextualizing the most commonly used mouse tumor immunology models against human cancer patient data. As the lead bioinformatician on my project, I closely collaborate with a team of scientists to address these questions. I am teaching myself `python` and `SQL`, as well as expanding my repertoire of data types to include bulk RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and CyTOF.

I crave challenge and enjoy embarking on new adventures, professionally and personally. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, and play lots of TTRPGs, and flex my artistic muscles while learning 3D CAD modeling and making handmade artisan dice.
