	  <center><h1>Rebecca G Jaszczak, PhD</h1></center>

I'm passionate about teaching myself new things. After over a decade of work in biology laboraties, I transitioned my focus to developing my expertise bioinformatics.<br><br>

I started college as an english major with a passion for creative writing and poetry, but quickly realized my aptitude for biology. My earliest infatuation with big data came from analyzing microarray dataset during my undergraduate work. I set my sights on graduate school, and spent a few years gaining research experience before earning admission to the University of California San Francisco for graduate school. In the lab of Dr. Diana Laird, I taught myself `R` and `bash`<br><br>

	  Currently investing in the future by characterizing mouse tumor immunology models and contextualizing them against human cancer patient data. I thrive on leveraging my extensive abilities to wrangle big data (including single cell technologies) and include salient statistics to draw meaningful conclusions in a biomedical context.</h1>
